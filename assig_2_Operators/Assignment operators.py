# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS IN PYTHON:
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

# Basic assignment
x = 5
print("Initial value: x =", x)

# Add AND assignment
x += 3  # x = x + 3
print("x += 3 =>", x)

# Subtract AND assignment
x -= 2  # x = x - 2
print("x -= 2 =>", x)

# Multiply AND assignment
x *= 4  # x = x * 4
print("x *= 4 =>", x)

# Divide AND assignment
x /= 3  # x = x / 3
print("x /= 3 =>", x)

# Modulus AND assignment
x %= 2  # x = x % 2
print("x %= 2 =>", x)

# Exponent AND assignment
x **= 2  # x = x ** 2
print("x **= 2 =>", x)

# Floor division AND assignment
x //= 2  # x = x // 2
print("x //= 2 =>", x)
